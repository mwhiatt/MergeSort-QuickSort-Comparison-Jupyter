# MergeSort-QuickSort-Comparison-Jupyter

Jupyter Notebook file that plots and compares the average number of comparisons made between quicksort and mergesort for 1000 vectors each of lengths 1 to 1000. We that mergesort makes less comparisons on the average, so if comparisons are our expensive operation we would obviously prefer to use mergesort. Created for Spring 2023 CS381 Homework 5.
